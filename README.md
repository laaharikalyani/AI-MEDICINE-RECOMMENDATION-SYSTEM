# AI POWERED DISEASE DIAGNOSIS AND MEDICINE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
This project is a web-based Disease Prediction System designed to predict possible diseases based on user-reported symptoms. Built using Python, Streamlit, and machine learning (Random Forest Classifier), the system provides not only predictions but also additional health- related recommendations such as medications, precautions, diet plans, and disease descriptions. The application offers a simple and interactive user interface that allows users to enter symptoms and receive instant, informative feedback. This tool serves as a basic pre- diagnostic assistant, helping users understand potential health issues before consulting a medical professional.
